I've worked and have deep experience in the whole product stack, from pure UI & UX design to the intrincancies of each technical layer under the hood, all the way to the leading aspect of bringing a product to life and leading creative and techincal teams to make it happen. Under all this, what I enjoy the most is building and creating those products.
